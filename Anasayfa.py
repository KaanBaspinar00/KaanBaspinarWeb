### About Me

Hello! I'm **Kaan Ba≈üpƒ±nar**, a physicist with a strong background in accelerator technologies and Martin-Puplett Interferometer (MPI). I have experience in Python programming and optical system design with ZEMAX. During my time at the Turkish Accelerator Radiation Laboratory (TARLA-FEL), I developed data analysis codes and worked on commissioning diagnostic cabinets.

I am deeply interested in topics such as deep learning, neuroscience, photoplethysmogram (PPG), and opto-electronics. I strive to combine my skills in physics and computer science to tackle challenging problems and contribute to innovative projects.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me!
